						The pandemic has started a trend of cooking at home. People make
						bread, cakes, and even some dishes that can only be cooked by those
						who obviously have a lot of spare time. These talented people are
						making all these fancy dishes. But I am a single man who has to
						travel from one city to another every day for work. When I get home,
						I just want to go to sleep, so I don't have the desire to cook for
						myself because that may make me feel even more lonely. As early as
						before the pandemic, I was very excited to find affordable and
						delicious restaurants in different cities. Although it may not be
						any delicacies, it is a great reward for my hard work. Also, there
						are different business dinners, so it will be beneficial for me to
						keep some restaurants in mind to host these events more easily.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, many of the restaurants I am
						familiar with cannot continue business for various reasons. When
						there was no lockdown, the number of people was fewer than before.
						Now is still a difficult time, and every industry desperately tries
						to hold on. Under all of these, gladly, my job is kinda stable. I
						need to travel between Chengdu and Pengzhou, which also allows me to
						visit different restaurants to find some food I like.
					</p>
					<p>
						For lunch, I have stir-fried dried mushrooms, and for dinner, I have
						Yun Nan traditional rice noodles.
					</p>
					<p>This restaurant in Pengzhou serves delicious pork soup.</p>
					<p>
						Simple two dishes and a soup, stir-fried fast food restaurant
						portions are large and cheap. Dinner is rice soup.
					</p>
					<p>
						Simple breakfast, I go to a Szechuan Style Restaurant with my
						colleague for two quick dishes at noon.
					</p>
					<p>⋯⋯</p>
					<p>After three days of waiting, neither more nor less,</p>
					<p>
						I received notice that my PCR test is positive, and I am going to be
						quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						"Ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching Zhanjiang West Station,
						please check your luggage and prepare to get off the train."
					</p>
					<p>
						I hold my luggage and prepare to get off the train—the familiar
						station, the same humid air as usual, but without any sense of home.
						I thought I might never return to this city again, but my family,
						whom I have decided not to rely on anymore, reached out with the
						news of a critical illness. My childhood playmates, they are sister
						and brother, called me to come back for a visit because this could
						be the last time. During my absence, they treat my mother as if she
						is their mother, so it is time to come back for a visit, for both
						friendship and kinship.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Long time no see!" I can feel the sister's enthusiasm through the
						mask, and the young brother is bashful as before. Because of the
						current pandemic prevention policy, I must be self-quarantined at
						home. There is no preparation at home because my mother has been
						admitted to the hospital. The sister kindly bought some necessities
						and food for me and promised me that she would come over every day
						to cook. Since I am in quarantine, I shouldn't go outside.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a few days like this, my quarantine life was very boring, only
						having a little entertainment with my friends during dinner time
						every day. The rest I can only spend my time watching TV shows and
						short videos on DouYin. My friends continued to go to the hospital.
						They transfer information like a bridge between my mother and me. My
						mother is happy that I am back, and things seem to have stabilized.
						They told me the house was quiet without me, but my mother kept my
						room tidy and looked forward to my return. When the sister is at
						work, she brings me back some local food from time to time, which
						tastes just the same as in my childhood memories. Although I am
						quarantined at home, I think I am healthy and do not look infected
						by any virus, and soon we all eat together at the table. I have two
						more days to go to the hospital to see my mom.
					</p>
					<p>
						The two boring days pass very quickly. To celebrate that I can
						finally leave home tomorrow, I take the PCR test and prepare food
						with the ingredients in the fridge while the brother brings some
						boba tea. We all have a great time, and it's probably been a long
						time since having such laughter in this little house.
					</p>
					<p>
						Late at night, I was told that I had tested positive for a PCR test
						and that the brother and sister might be in trouble too.
					</p>
					<p>The future is uncertain. I am going to be quarantined. </p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>"Okay, I'll be back soon."</p>
					<p>
						The call hung up, leaving only the empty ringing sound. Perhaps I
						grew up under the shade of my grandparents, and until the year I
						went to college, I chose to study abroad. I still miss them the
						most. But a pandemic made the journey home a long one. One's health
						is deteriorating, and after a phone call with my family, I decide to
						return.
					</p>
					<p>
						The two-week-long quarantine was not easy, and the anxiety in my
						heart is magnified during the lonely nights. When I see my family
						again, the elders look older than I thought. When I was a kid, they
						always took me on the bus and went to different places in the city.
						But now, the bus ride to the People's Hospital is like an unknown
						void, and I don't know what I will see in the hospital and what I
						need to accept. The elders were once in excellent health, but the
						health of the elderly is sometimes like a storm that catches people
						off guard, like dominoes falling on their sides with no sign of a
						turnaround. The pandemic? I don't care about that anymore. The
						pandemic is not as important as my family! Although my sanity told
						me that I am young and perhaps not so afraid of the virus, and I
						have repeatedly told the elders to stay at home to avoid exposure to
						the virus in the hospital, they couldn't settle down at home. It
						seems that a family member, a life, will pass away in unseen time,
						and everyone wants to look after him. So, the back and forth between
						home and hospital continued until August 30th. The two-week-long

					<p>
						The doctor issued a notice of critical illness in the afternoon of
						this day. In the doctors' and nurses' rescue, in the end, they could
						not pull back life from the hands of death. The time was paused at
						8:00 pm. But we also know that death may be a kind of relief.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the pandemic, everything has to be kept simple. My family and
						I bought the wreath and decorations for the funeral the next day,
						and the memorial hall was well prepared. Not many friends and
						relatives can be there, but I feel everyone under the masks bids a
						friend and a loved one farewell. A long life has come to an end in
						three days.
					</p>
					<p>
						We may be children of the soil, and we will all return to the soil's
						embrace in the end. And at this time, I received a notice that I am
						asymptomatic positive, and I am going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						Retirement is a leisurely life, especially since the pandemic began.
						Every day I go to the market near my home at 8 a.m. on time, and
						it's usually crowded: mobile stalls selling breakfast, rushed
						commuters, busy shopkeepers, bargain hunters... It's also the time
						of day when I can buy the freshest vegetables and meat. As the
						pandemic begins, these noises are gradually muffled under masks, and
						even the yelling seems to have been muted. People have become
						increasingly cautious, afraid to meet people face to face, fearful
						that they would become close contacts and even infected with the
						virus. The crowd is not as busy as it once was, and the health QR
						codes that must be used with smartphones to access the enclosed area
						have made it difficult for customers to reunite at this small
						market.
					</p>
					<p>
						My children keep mentioning on the phone that the elderly have poor
						resistance and are a high-risk group for the virus. I'm too old to
						go anywhere. The only activity for me once a day is to catch up with
						the people in the morning and drop by my old friends' stores, who
						are also small local business owners. After the PCR test, there is
						only a retired elder at home, doing ordinary household chores,
						chatting with the TV, having a simple meal, and walking after
						dinner. It may not be a wonderful life, but it also reminds me that
						it is real because it's plain and simple. If I can be infected with
						a virus in this life, maybe this is my fate.
					</p>
					<p>
						The phone rang early in the morning, and I received a notice that my
						PCR test result was positive. I am going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						I've been living in this city for decades, but this is the first
						time I have encountered such an unusual situation. I barely keep up
						with the trend of using a smartphone. Without one, I may not even be
						able to get in and out of my neighborhood. Most of my old friends in
						the retirement center can't adapt and don't have the energy to
						tinker with this little machine in their hands. After all, the words
						on it are probably too small for us to read. Nevertheless, we still
						meet here almost every day for no other reason than that life has
						not been typical over the past few years, and perhaps we would all
						rather be happy in the midst of misery than be alone at home. Taking
						the risk of seeing friends, maybe talking about the world, or having
						a nice cup of tea together, is better than being reminded repeatedly
						at home that we are out of touch with society these days.
					</p>
					<p>
						Recently, PCR tests have become increasingly frequent; there are
						already once a day. Other than that, my everyday life is probably
						limited to grocery shopping in the market and a little activity in
						the park in my neighborhood during my leisure time. Compare to other
						places where people are locked up at home, it is fortunate that we
						can still go around on our own.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, yesterday I received a notice that my test result is
						positive, and I need to go to be quarantined. I just hope that all
						my old friends are well…
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						Since the pandemic has been developing, I always believe the virus
						will not infect me as long as I have good protection. Therefore,
						gloves, masks, and hand sanitizers have been standard setups for me.
						To make a living, I can't stop working. These protections are the
						best way to protect my family and employees. Although the farmers'
						market is not crowded, it is slightly getting better. I discussed
						with the shop owner to prepare fresh ingredients for my store and
						have them delivered tomorrow, as always. My creed is that
						preparation is the answer to every situation, not only in cooking
						but also in epidemics.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today I heard from an employee that the most susceptible moment is
						when people are in line, waiting for PCR testing. At first glance,
						it seems absurd, but it could still be a serious thought when you
						think about it. Even though I am fully protected, I still have to
						take off my mask during the test. Maybe it's true, or maybe it's
						just another ridiculous rumor. There are too many maybes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, I probably don't need to think about it anymore. Even
						though I'm prepared, even though I've done everything I can, I'm
						still infected with the virus, I'm positive, and I'm going to be
						quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						Summer is almost over, but because of the pandemic, the school start
						date keeps changing. No one may care about this, and some may even
						be happy. At home, TV, smartphone, and computer are the three things
						that fill my life. Even though my neighborhood is not in lockdown,
						the positive cases occasionally make me and my family go out less
						often. I've been able to play video games and talk with my friends
						online, but it's been a while since the last time I went to play
						basketball with them. Maybe I'm looking forward to my new school, or
						I'm bummed about the end of the holidays and the summer assignments
						that I haven't even touched. It's better not to think about it so
						much and play a couple of rounds of video games.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although we've been staying home, as required by the government,
						we've been getting regular PCR tests, maybe once every two days,
						maybe once a day. As the news has said, this hateful virus is now
						most serious for the elderly and children, but I'm in good health,
						and even if I get sick, that will be mild for me. It's just that I
						often think back to the time two years ago when I hung out with my
						friends, went to the boba tea shop, went to the bookstore, and went
						to the game room together. In the past two years, we seem to get
						used to everything going online, taking online classes, playing
						games online, watching videos, and listening to songs. Many times we
						feel that life is not very realistic, but the reality of it makes
						people feel uncomfortable.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, the Education Bureau sent a notice that school would start
						next week. I am still immersed in the laziness of the holidays. I
						begin to feel nervous until I couldn't finish my summer assignments.
						I may meet new classmates, new teachers, new schools, maybe all new.
						I may be in a serious mood, ready to face more and more stressful
						school work, but I will also be happy to meet and laugh with my
						friends again. Maybe this will be my last year in school, and I will
						be worried about an even more uncertain future...
					</p>
					<p>
						A phone call brought me back to reality. My test result is positive,
						I'm going to be quarantined, and the vacation starts again.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						A pandemic has made things even more difficult for us caterers. I
						may have been rooted in this city for years, trapped by the
						pandemic, barely able to keep my business afloat. Or maybe I'm
						trying to bottom out in a declining market and take a gamble with
						nature. Either way, the lockdown is over, and it should be getting
						better, right? People are slowly coming out of their homes, and
						there is already a line in the city office. Then, I have a bowl of
						lamb noodles that I have not eaten in a long time, and the taste has
						not changed, but dining in is much better than take-out. In the
						supermarket, perhaps people are no longer as crazy as before to
						stock up, but still subconsciously will buy a little more, just in
						case. In the evening, old friends have a barbecue party, beer, and
						kebabs. I have forgotten the last time I had such a meal.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many times I think this kind of life is what we want. A big mouthful
						of meat, a big mouthful of wine, diners eat happily, we earn money
						and also gain happiness. No matter how developed and convenient
						Internet life is, there is no way to replace the joy of raising a
						glass at the dinner table with friends. Everyone takes off their
						mask, breathes in the fresh air, and feels the aroma of the food
						together. When can we fully return to this kind of life?
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's just say, not right now. I've been notified that my PCR test
						result is positive, and I'm going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						The autumn breeze is a sign that the year is almost over. I have
						been staying at home for the past two days and have no intention of
						going out. I may have flowers and plants on the balcony and a fish
						tank in the living room. I take care of these different beings. I
						might turn on the TV, watch a movie and cook myself a meal in my
						spare time at home. The outside world doesn't seem to be that
						attractive to me. I want to live my ordinary life well, continue to
						be common, and have nothing more to ask for, just like you.
						Occasionally, when I get tired of eating the food I made, I think
						about going outside to find something different. "What should I eat?
						Pan-fried buns." The joy of ordinary people's lives often comes from
						the comfort of food and the practice of my human desires. Three
						years after the pandemic started, taking PCR tests has become my
						daily routine. There is no harm in that, I guess, the PCR test keeps
						me from getting sick and gives me the proof, the health code I need
						to continue my life. I don't know what it's like to have this
						disease, but maybe it's dangerous, and we're all afraid of getting
						it. After all, I can't leave the house, I still need to take care of
						the plants, and the house will be dusty after a few days without
						anyone living there.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before I buy food, I'd better get a PCR test. I haven't done it for
						a long time, and I may need to go out of town in a few days. Maybe
						some places will let me in only if I provide a 48-hour negative PCR
						result. I may need the test result anyway. The government is still
						doing an excellent job in this area, at least my PCR tests are free.
						After the PCR test, I got the pancake I wanted to eat, and it was
						time to go home. I usually get my results within 24 hours, so I'll
						just relax at home today, do some chores, and have some fun at home,
						or maybe, Is there something else in my life that I'm worried about?
						I'll be dreaming at night, or maybe like you, turning on my phone to
						watch an interesting video before I fall asleep. Maybe like you, I
						don't fall asleep that easily and like to toss and turn before I
						fall asleep. Maybe like you, I am a person who falls asleep as soon
						as I hit the pillow. Maybe like you, I like to spend some family
						time with my family.
					</p>
					<p>The dream may still be as sweet as when I fell asleep.</p>
					<p>
						I wake up, the sun comes out, and I receive a notice that there was
						a positive case at the pancake store I went to yesterday, and the
						message told me that I should have more PCR tests, which is fine. I
						am doing it for my health, just to make sure. But at the same time,
						I had some worries: What if I was infected? Will I be quarantined? I
						am a little hesitant about the PCR test. I am wondering if I should
						go for it. "Nah, maybe just one more," I said. I'm not that
						susceptible to infection, and I don't feel anything, right? Anyway,
						I am going for another PCR test. There will be more in the following
						days. If I hadn't eaten the pancakes that day, I wouldn't have had
						close contact with a positive case, and I wouldn't have had to take
						the test every day. I can't help it; I have to go on with my life.
						I'll go home and do my things first, and then I'll be done with the
						PCR test in the next few days. The pandemic in the past few years
						has been so bad that I think many people have chosen to stay at
						home.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's a new day and another PCR test. I still don't know what my PCR
						test results will be. I guess they will call me soon. In fact, I
						think the color design of this health code is really intuitive.
						Green, just like the green traffic light, my ordinary life can still
						go on usually; Yellow, just like the yellow traffic light,
						everything will become slightly slow and inconvenient; And red, just
						like the red traffic light, is the stop button of my life. Don't you
						find it interesting? When your life can be controlled by a program
						displayed on the screen. Ha-ha-ha, I sometimes think it's funny as
						if my life can actually be paused. I'm afraid my life will stop, I
						know it may not be that bad, but I don't want it to happen. I don't
						want people to control my life. Would you? Before I sleep tonight,
						should I be prepared for my PCR test to be positive tomorrow? I
						don't know. No signs are telling me what to do tomorrow. I don't
						seem to have a choice. If my test is negative, I will continue with
						my everyday life. If my test is positive, I will be quarantined. I
						may look like I have a choice, but I don't. It's not me deciding how
						I should live. Maybe it's the disease deciding how I should live.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm going to be quarantined, yes, I probably expected my test to be
						positive. It's just for a few days, maybe? By the way, who are you?
						Do we know each other?
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						I've been getting PCR tests for the past two days, and they say that
						the pandemic in my city is severe at this time of year. Yes, autumn
						is here. From the previous two years, it seems to have been heard
						saying that the virus will spread faster and more expansive when
						autumn and winter come. I still believe this because the pandemic is
						always back and forth, one wave after another. Does it seem that the
						number of infected people is indeed more in the winter? I have long
						been accustomed to PCR testing. It is just a formality, anyway. I
						went so many times and have not tested positive. The chance of
						infection may not be so high. I have not heard of anyone being
						infected because of the PCR test. Even though many people gather
						together during the test, it doesn't matter. Positive cases are
						always the minority.
					</p>
					<p>
						After all, I have done it two days in a row, and the results are
						negative. I should go to the market today and buy some food to take
						home. I should have cooked a good meal at home, and it seems that
						there is not much oil left in the house for cooking, so it is time
						to go to the market. I might want to buy something for my family,
						and I might want to make a nice dinner for my kids. I'm happy I can
						go to the market and buy what I want, and I'm so glad I can make a
						nice dinner at home. Are you asking what I am happy about? Isn't
						this my most ordinary, everyday life? I don't know, and I am not
						sure. I don't know why, but since the beginning of the pandemic, I
						feel that I should cherish my daily life. Maybe I should cherish the
						green health code in my phone, too, because it ensures my life can
						run normally. The night has come with the approach of winter, and
						now it seems to be getting darker day by day. I just got another
						notice that I still have to go for a PCR test tomorrow.
					</p>
					<p>
						The PCR test seems to just interlude my daily life. There are many
						electric bikes in our village, running quietly every day, with the
						riders, going here and there. When they run out of power, they need
						to be recharged at home. Occasional charging does not affect the use
						of the electric bikes, and occasionally there is a small bump on the
						road, which the electric bikes can easily pass. These are all
						interludes that keep the electric bike running smoothly and
						uninterruptedly. The PCR test is considered to recharge my
						batteries! If you do it a few more times, the pandemic will be gone!
						I have two more PCR tests in a row, and this time, I am not lucky.
						The result is positive, and I'm going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						I haven't been out of the house for the past few days but for the
						PCR test. I insisted on going for the PCR test for the past two
						days, and I go out again today for it. I return at noon, have a
						small lunch at home, and in the afternoon, my family asks me to go
						and throw out the garbage at home. I actually like the road of
						walking to the garbage dump. I can look at the scenery on the way,
						take a break, and say hello to the neighbors in the village.
						Although sometimes people tell me that our village should change the
						location of the garbage dump or the way they collect garbage,
						because when I walk there in the afternoon it may be fine, but at
						night, especially in winter, it's really dark and cold to walk
						there. I should rest at home tomorrow, I've had the PCR test for
						three days in a row, so I don't think I'll have any problems. What
						should I do?
					</p>
					<p>
						I got the notification that my PCR test results are out, and it's
						positive, so I am going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						I have lived in this village for many, many years, and life in the
						countryside is peaceful, away from the hustle and bustle of the big
						city. My job is to work on my family's farm. Do you think this is
						comfortable, or my unchanging life is boring? Since the pandemic,
						the village has been asking us to go for PCR testing. Over the past
						few years, seems like my life has changed a bit? But maybe most
						stayed the same. I have heard people say that the PCR test is like a
						small part of our lives, it only takes ten minutes! It doesn't
						affect my life very much, I guess. I usually wake up in the morning,
						have breakfast with my family, feed my dog, and head out into the
						sunshine to work on my family's farm. If you ask me if this is the
						land that my family passed down to me, I am not sure, but I am sure
						that it is the land that I was given by the government later. I have
						a piece of farmland to cultivate, and maybe it is my freedom to
						plant whatever I want. I work until noon, until the sun is blazing,
						and then I take a break and eat something simple. In the afternoon,
						I go to the village entrance to meet my friends and play cards or
						chat. Then, until the sun sets in the west, we go home slowly
						smelling the smell of each family starting to cook. I have heard
						that people have lived in rhythm with the earth's rotation around
						the sun for thousands of years. I enjoy the nighttime every day. In
						the village, the night is tranquil, without the noisy traffic in the
						city. There may be crickets chirping, frogs chirping, and you may
						hear children's laughter from the next house, until the moon hangs
						in the middle of the sky intact, all the sounds gradually
						extinguished. I go to dreamland.
					</p>
					<p>
						I wake up at sunrise and receive a notice that my PCR test result is
						positive. I am going to be quarantined.
					</p>

					<p>
						I live in a jewelry company in a small town where I may be an
						employee, or I may be the owner. I started working for this jewelry
						company right after I graduated from school. My family lives not too
						far away, and I chose to live in the company to save my daily
						commute time to work. In fact, as a jewelry company, It is better to
						have someone stay at night to ensure the safety of the inventory,
						and in many cases, I choose to work the night shift in the company
						so that I can find a place for me to rest at night while I work.
						Although I have lived in the jewelry company for most of my life,
						there are still different places I need to go every day. Today, for
						example, I was going to visit a friend's house nearby. My friend
						lives in a nearby village, and this friend is from the same village
						as me. I just happened to get a chance to go home and visit. Work,
						so that I get paid, so that I can feed myself and my family.
						Occasionally, I still have to go home to visit. I stay in the
						village until the early morning before I go back to the jewelry
						company slowly. I am curious to know when the jewelry company has
						become an important place in my life, a place to rest at night, a
						place to work at night. I stay at the jewelry company until the next
						afternoon and then go to the village. This village is where I grew
						up, and my life seems to be divided into two parts by two different
						places, one for work and living and the other for fun and
						relaxation. Two different lives in two different areas. Would you
						say my life is happy? Sometimes I feel that my life is good, and
						sometimes I look at the mundanity of my life. Today is the same as
						yesterday. I go back to the office from the village in the early
						morning and plan to spend my night at the office. By the way, I
						forgot to tell you that I like to go out and buy some food before
						returning to the office. I don't seem to care much about whether a
						late-night snack is healthy. Tonight, I decided to have some pot
						stickers.
					</p>
					<p>
						I sometimes wonder if my work and my life are really separate, I
						just seem to have two different places to live, but I don't know
						which one I can call home. I don't call the company my home, maybe
						it's just because my family is not here, my familiar neighbors are
						not here, and I am alone. If it weren't for the familiar sights and
						people, I wouldn't be able to tell where my home is. You can say
						that I live a constant, boring day, the days are spent in a
						day-to-day cycle, but I would like to ask, how many people are the
						same as me in this society? I am asking about the percentage.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's been a long time since I've had roast pork and the Chongqing
						noodles I loved when I was a student. I decided to go to the
						supermarket this afternoon to buy some daily necessities and maybe
						buy my food for the day too. After I finish shopping, there is still
						some time before I go to work, so I go back to the village again to
						chat with my family. Maybe it's not as attractive as you think, but
						just a normal part of life. Before I went to work early in the
						morning, I couldn't resist buying pot stickers. I really like the
						pot stickers made by this small store. It is very convenient and
						close to my company, and it tastes delicious, and the price is also
						very fair. After buying the pot stickers, I remember that the
						company seemed to be missing some office supplies, so I had to go to
						the supermarket again. After I finished shopping, I went back to the
						office, stayed until noon, and bought some food at the convenience
						store before going home. It was a weekend, and I didn't have to work
						on Sunday, so I stayed in the village until late afternoon and
						decided to buy some dinner. After eating, I walked, browsed the
						supermarket, and thought about what else I needed at home. The
						village is still so quiet at night. Do you think most villages have
						a calm night like mine, where people like to walk around the village
						slowly and enjoy a moment of leisure?
					</p>
					<p>
						How is my life going during this pandemic? I don't know. My life is
						so regular, my health code is always green, and I have no intention
						of getting a PCR test. I don't think I will get this disease. I
						haven't heard of anyone around me getting it. So enjoy my weekend,
						after the workday starts, it's time to go back to work, will the
						days go in the same cycle?
					</p>
					<p>
						Today, they told me to get ready for quarantine. I didn't have any
						feeling that I was sick. They said that I had close contact with a
						person who is positive and I was going to be quarantined. After
						looking at my life, do you think this break in the cycle of my life
						is supposed to make me happy? Should it make me sad? I don't know. A
						period of vacancy only made me realize that my life had been put on
						hold.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						I have to go to school every day, to the middle school in our city.
						You ask me whether I go for work or for school? I don't know, but
						does it make any real difference? We all go to the same places, and
						we all follow the same daily trajectory. I wake up every weekday and
						go to school until the end of the school day. After school, I go
						straight home, or buy some snacks on the way home, or buy some
						drinks or daily necessities at the convenience store. Then I go back
						to school the next day. I go to school, as usual. What happened in
						school today may have happened to you. After school, I return to the
						village and go to my relatives' house for dinner. According to the
						plan, tomorrow should be another day to return to school. But when I
						wake up, they said that a positive patient had visited the snack bar
						I had been to the day before, so I should go and quarantine myself
						as a close contact. It looks like it was time to leave school and my
						regular life for a while. I get a vacation of unknown duration, do
						you think I should be happy? I'm wondering whether I should go to
						the snack bar that day. I don't know, but for now, I am going to be
						quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						The recent pandemic has been repetitive, and I've heard so much
						about people starting to get sick again. I am curious if I'll be
						next, and if I am, what will I encounter? In what way did our paths
						cross? Did we go to the same places? Do we have similar lives? I
						don't know. This weekend, I thought I should buy something for my
						family, so I went to the department store in the next village, as
						going out on weekends is always the most familiar, relaxing, and
						popular way to chill. I know a delicious snack bar near the
						department store, which I often visit. The food is delicious, the
						prices are affordable, and it's not far from my house. I seem to be
						feeling a little sick lately, but I don't think I have one of those
						pandemic diseases. After all, I don't have any symptoms of Covid.
						Maybe it's a chronic disease. I'm going to the hospital in our city
						in the afternoon to get a prescription from the doctor, and perhaps
						I can get some medicine from the pharmacy to make me feel better.
						Since the pandemic's beginning, whenever I feel unwell, I feel a bit
						scared, afraid of getting sick and being quarantined. Before I go
						home, I'd rather eat out casually. The leisure time at night is no
						different from others, just relaxing at home. You ask me if I have a
						nighttime entertainment life. I might have, but I haven't recently.
						Maybe I need some exciting activities, or maybe ordinary life can
						satisfy me.
					</p>
					<p>
						When the sun comes up again, I brush my teeth, get ready, eat
						breakfast, and go out for my PCR test. I don't know what people
						think of the PCR test, but I don't know if I hate it since it
						doesn't particularly bother me. After all, it doesn't take long to
						get a PCR test each time, but recently I seem to have heard people
						say that the gathering of people during the PCR test makes the
						disease spread even faster. I don't get it either! After all, this
						is what my life is set up to do! The life I am set up to live! After
						the PCR test, I stop by the grocery store to pick up some food. I
						will get a haircut this afternoon, so I just grabbed something for
						lunch at the grocery store. I am delighted with my new hairstyle.
						The hairstylist worked on it from afternoon to evening, and it was
						time for dinner, you know, how much can one do in a day? Before I
						went home, I bought some food outside, and went to the convenience
						store to bring some snacks home for my kids to eat, and the weekend
						was over in an uneventful, busy, leisurely, and fulfilling time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Today is Monday, and according to the general schedule, I have to
						take my kids to kindergarten, but today I have to go to the PCR test
						in the morning, so I let the other family members go. I picked up
						the kids from school in the afternoon, took them to buy snacks,
						shopped at the supermarket, and bought the ingredients for dinner
						for the family. The family's dinner is not only simple but happy.
					</p>
					<p>
						Early Tuesday morning, I received notice that I was a close contact.
						I am going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						Ha-ha-ha, you ask me about my life? What? You didn't ask me but read
						it yourself? Well, you can see what my life has been like this week;
						it's a little hard to describe. I didn't go anywhere, but I did have
						four PCR tests. I'm probably just an average working person, with
						the few pleasures of life being a daily walk around in my
						neighborhood after dinner. Four consecutive PCR testing in four
						days, either at my company's or the community's request, and when
						they told me I was going to be quarantined, I didn't know when I got
						the disease. Do you think it's possible that so many people gathered
						during the PCR test and caused me to be infected? I really don't
						understand it. Anyway, it could be that I got the disease during
						walking or I got it at work, it doesn't matter, anyway, I am going
						to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						I am a jewelry salesman. Since the pandemic began, our store's
						business has been affected a bit, but unsurprisingly, I have to go
						to work every day, including weekends. Usually, more people come in
						on weekends, and the store is busier. If you ask me if there is
						anything special about my life, I think there is probably nothing.
						What is unique is that after the pandemic started, I sometimes had
						to get a PCR test before going home. I've been doing this for three
						years, and sometimes I think I'm lucky. In the past three years,
						I've seen too many stores close and many people lose their jobs.
						Maybe I'm fortunate. God knows how many times I've had a PCR test
						over the years, but I've kept doing the test for three years, and
						I've never been the unfortunate one, I've never had the disease.
						Today, I'm going to do the PCR test and go to the mall to buy
						something. I want to see the jewelry in the mall, which is one of my
						few interests. No extraordinary life, no special dinner. Before I go
						to sleep, I may think that tomorrow will be the same cycle. But when
						I woke up, I was told to stay at home and that someone would come to
						take me to the quarantine. Even though I don't feel anything, I
						probably still have this disease. Okay, I've been lucky enough for
						three years, so it's time for me to be quarantined.
					</p>

					<p>
						It is another National Day, and like the past two years, I don't
						want to go out this holiday, and this year I don't even feel the
						urge to go out for dinner and drinks with friends. I just want to
						enjoy a moment of tranquility, a moment of not being shot in the
						forehead by a body temperature gun, a moment of not having to wear
						this weak but critical protection on my ears. I want to be able to
						enjoy the food, endlessly watch the shows, and sleep as I please,
						it's a perfect vacation.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the past few days, the only thing I've gone out for is to have my
						PCR test done.
					</p>
					<p>Several times, the test was negative.</p>
					<p>(A few days later)</p>
					<p>The phone rang.</p>
					<p>I got the result back.</p>
					<p>It was positive,</p> <p>but I was asymptomatic positive.</p>
					<p>What a perfect vacation.</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						On the last day of the holiday, I decided to go with my elders to
						visit my relatives whom I have not seen for a long time. They are
						relieved to see that everyone is well. The old generation has been
						working hard all life-long, and the Chinese medicine clinic
						downstairs of my apartment always provides excellent care and
						relief. We barely leave our home these days, so now is the time to
						let everyone enjoy themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						The rest of the holiday is nice. I spend some time in the hot
						springs and parks, playing in the water and reliving the taste of
						the grass.
					</p>
					<p>
						The child next to me is laughing happily, and at this time, I
						receive a notice that I am asymptomatic positive.
					</p>
					<p>The elders in my family, too.</p>
					<p>We are going to be quarantined.</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						It is 1:00 p.m., another day closer to the end of the holiday. I'm
						running out of food at home, so I hope there's still some fresh meat
						and vegetables in the supermarket downstairs. I'm in e-commerce, and
						I have to say that this pandemic has made my company's business
						better, and with everyone at home on their phones, there's no better
						opportunity than this.
					</p>
					<p>
						What? The real economy is in a recession? What can we do? Our money,
						our communication, now are all on this tiny screen... You can call
						me a speculator, but making a living is not wrong, right? The real
						economy has bad luck, and those people choose the wrong starting
						line. This may be their fate. It will not be too late to pity them
						when I can have fine dining for dinner every day. Now I can only
						have this meal, suffer and live with it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another day at work, nine to six, commuting from home for one and a
						half hours. I used to pretend to be a good student, and now I
						pretend to be a good employee. Maybe it is my first day after the
						holiday. I am a bit tired.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the middle of the night, I am told on the phone that I have been
						diagnosed with the virus and I am going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						"The mall is not as crowded as it used to be." I've heard my
						colleague say this a dozen times over the past year or so. What can
						we do about it? People are now stuck at home! "It will be fine after
						a while. There will be more and more people going out, right? The
						other colleague always has the same answer. The first one may have a
						child who has just started elementary school, while the second
						colleague may have just gotten married, and I may have just
						graduated from college. For living, we gather at this cosmetic
						counter. According to their saying, the National Day holiday was
						supposed to be one of the peaks in sales, but now, with only a few
						guests with the masks on their faces, our counter has been uncrowded
						for quite a while.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's not hard to work, and we can talk together, so we don't feel
						bored. We talked about life, my colleagues' children, the joy of our
						new marriage, celebrities, and jobs. ...... Time passed in a flash.
						Every day during the PCR test, I can also stop by the supermarket to
						buy some snacks to keep myself focused on work until 10 pm.
					</p>
					<p>
						I initially thought everything would pass calmly until I received
						notice that I was diagnosed with the virus, and my colleagues are
						also considered close contacts. As a result, we are all going to be
						quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						The teachers from our kindergarten told us that we should wash our
						hands more often and pay attention to hygiene. I don't know if it's
						hard for you to imagine how much of my life this pandemic has taken
						up so far because I'm much younger than you. Do you remember when
						you were in kindergarten? That was probably many, many years ago,
						and I don't think about it as much as you adults do! We might have
						learned songs about the pandemic in kindergarten, and our teachers
						might have told us that those who wore protective clothing are
						heroes, great heroes! When you were a child, did you also look up to
						those great heroes? In fact, life in kindergarten is not as easy as
						adults think. Our parents sent us to kindergarten so someone could
						take care of us while they are at work. Today is just like any other
						day, a Thursday, I still have to go to kindergarten. I may be sad to
						leave home or I may be looking forward to seeing my friends. But I
						was feeling a little sick today. I ate breakfast with my dad at the
						bakery downstairs from our home, and he took me to kindergarten. I
						met the teacher, who noticed that I wasn't feeling well and asked my
						dad to take me home. The teacher was also very nervous, afraid that
						I was a positive case. After I got home with my dad, after I stayed
						home for a while, I didn't seem to feel so bad anymore. People said
						my symptoms might be due to bad food in the morning? I don't know! I
						went back to kindergarten in the afternoon and my dad couldn't pick
						me up until he got off work. In the evening, I seemed to feel worse.
						My dad thought I had a cold, but he said for my safety, we should go
						for a PCR test. It was 10pm, and I wanted to go to bed, but my dad
						took me to the PCR test anyway.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the test, I felt worse and worse. I might have a cough or a
						fever, and for the next two days they told me to stay home and not
						to go anywhere. I heard that a lot of adults are going to be
						quarantined, so am I going to be quarantined too? I may not care
						about quarantine as much as you adults do because my dad told me
						that if I went to quarantine, I wouldn't have to go to kindergarten
						and I could watch TV every day!
					</p>
					<p>
						The next day, my dad told me that my PCR test results came back and
						he told me that I was going to be quarantined. I should be happy
						that I can watch my favorite TV show for the next few weeks without
						going to school. But I also miss my friends in kindergarten a bit.
					</p>
					<p>
						I work in a supermarket and specialize in toilet paper sales. Ask me
						about my life? My life is nothing unique, it's the same as most
						people around me. We go to work on weekdays, and in our supermarket,
						there are three shifts every day, sometimes I work the morning shift
						and sometimes the evening shift. I work eight hours a day, my life
						is quite regular, my work may not be too difficult. Today, I started
						walking home after I got off work at 6 pm. Sometimes I may also
						admire the prosperity of this city, looking at the people in a hurry
						on the way home from work, I may also be curious about everyone's
						life, just like you. I often bump into my neighbors on my way home,
						and we always have a friendly chat and share our day. We are having
						a simple dinner to end an ordinary but satisfying day.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next day, I worked the morning shift and the evening shift. I
						had to go to the supermarket at 7:30 am to prepare for the day's
						work, and I left work at 12:00 noon. In fact, sometimes I think this
						kind of work schedule is quite good. After I finish work at noon, I
						have a lot of time to prepare a meal for my family before I go to
						work at night. On my way home, I saw some fresh fruit at a fruit
						stand on the roadside and bought some fruit to share with my family.
						My daughter told me she needed some supplies for school, and there
						was an office supply store right next to the fruit stand, so I could
						bring some supplies home for my daughter. Luckily I remembered,
						otherwise she wouldn't be able to do her homework! I had to go to
						work again at 6:00 pm. The evening shift ended at 10:00 pm. I had a
						quick dinner before going to work. After all, I didn't have much
						time left after work. At the end of my shift, my day was over.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you really ask me what the disadvantage of this job is, it may be
						that I have to work on weekends. There is no reason for supermarkets
						to be closed on weekends, right? This Saturday, I worked the late
						shift, so I had some time to myself in the morning. I planned to go
						shopping and buy something for myself. I might have bought some
						clothes, some decorations, and some useful things for my home. The
						supermarket job allows me to deal with different people every day. I
						say different people, but in fact, most of them are neighbors who
						live nearby. In the evening after work, I had to go with my two
						daughters for a PCR test, which was a bit far away, and we had to
						take a taxi. It was almost midnight, and I couldn't finish my day
						until 12:00 am. Do you think my day was busy or fulfilling?
					</p>
					<p>
						My neighbor and I go to the market early in the morning to buy
						groceries for our family. My neighbor is about my age and has a
						family to care for. We wanted to get to the market early so that we
						could buy the freshest food. While shopping, I got a call saying
						that our PCR results came back yesterday and that we were probably
						positive and needed to get tested again immediately. I had to go
						home and take my daughter with me to get her PCR done. Too many
						people lined up at the PCR testing station, and it was a crowded
						scene. I asked my daughter to wait in line while I went to buy
						something for us to eat. We hadn't had breakfast today. We waited in
						line until almost noon before we finished the PCR test, and I wasn't
						going to go out today, so I went home to rest. I'll have a quick
						dinner with my family, maybe watch TV and relax, or maybe I'll have
						a lot of chores to do. Just as I was about to go to bed, just after
						midnight, I received a notice that my PCR results were positive. I
						was told to stay home and that someone would come to take me to
						quarantine now. What can I do with the vegetables I just bought this
						morning if I am going to be quarantined?
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						It's been a week since school started, and I've been up early these
						days, but my mom is always awake and has breakfast ready before me.
						On the way to school, I might meet a few classmates so we can go to
						school together. The road to school was not particularly far. I
						could see many hot breakfast stands on the way, which looked very
						tasty. I could see other parents dropping off their children at
						school, and I also wanted that too, so that I could get to school
						before everyone else. Although we can all go to school together now,
						we still need to wear masks. My mom has told me not to take off my
						mask and not to eat snacks during class, but I can still see some of
						my classmates doing it. Because it was the beginning of a new
						semester, the teachers didn't assign much homework. The new textbook
						is full of content that my deskmate said she knew, but I was
						confused.
					</p>
					<p>
						Soon the morning class was over, and my friends and I went to the
						supply store next to the school to buy new supplies after lunch. My
						father also said that in order for me to study well, he decided to
						give me a hundred bucks, which was enough for me to buy a pencil
						case, some book covers, and the latest comic book. There were many
						new things in the supply store, but the line at the checkout was
						really long, I couldn't wait! After I got home, my mom and dad
						helped me organize my school bag, which was small but heavy. I went
						back to school after 1:00 and started my afternoon class. The
						afternoon classes often made me sleepy, and even the teachers were
						not very energetic. At 10:00 pm, my parents took me to have my PCR
						test done, as they had been doing for over a year, but I still hated
						being poked in the nose with a cotton swab. It was very
						uncomfortable. So this is how I spent two days in a row.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the weekend, my mom and dad each took me to have a PCR test.
						But in the evening, my mom received a phone call and looked very
						alarmed. At 1 o'clock after midnight, some people in protective
						clothing came knocking on the door. Mom, dad, and I were taken away
						together. I missed my school bag, my new supplies, and the noisy
						classroom. I don't feel sick, but the result is positive today and
						I'm going to be quarantined.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						PCR test! I feel like this is one of the few reasons I can get out.
						I live in this rental apartment with my two roommates. We may be
						recent graduates, maybe we are just a few of the people who came to
						the city from another part of the country to work, maybe my two
						roommates and I should not have known each other except for the
						intersection of living. But at least we have a harmonious life
						together, and they both add a lot of fun to my life. At least I have
						someone to talk to when I go home. My roommates, just like me, don't
						like to go out in their spare time, probably because we live in a
						building with everything we need. If you want to have some good
						food, just order delivery, if you want to exercise, you can do it in
						the building, if you want to have fun, we like to play games at
						home, and we can even do our own work at home. It seems less
						necessary to go out, right? The world outside the window is still in
						the pandemic, and I sometimes fantasize that this box of concrete,
						steel and glass can isolate me from the outside world and that what
						happens outside of the window may never have anything to do with me.
						But the reality is not like this. Outside of a box, there is another
						box, the city is a big box, there are more people in this big box.
						And everyone seems to be the gears that provide the power for the
						city to run, connected to each other, but there is no need to know
						each other. If one gear has an abnormality, the other gears can't
						run properly, right? This is how things have been going since the
						first year of the pandemic, and I have been involved in it for a
						long time, doing PCR tests and not being able to avoid it, even
						without going out. You ask me if it is possible to live my life
						differently before the pandemic started. Of course, it is possible,
						but that doesn't matter anymore. The pandemic has changed everyone's
						life, changed the way they live. Three days ago, I had my PCR test
						as usual. For three days, I am at home, spending time with my
						roommates or working on our own stuff, or taking care of a few
						potted plants at home. Three days later, I don’t know why I received
						the notification that the test result was positive. Maybe it's the
						same as I think at the beginning, the gears, we are all closely
						connected but far apart gears, silently turning, running for the end
						result that I may not see. I'm going to be quarantined, leave this
						home for a while. Perhaps my work, my entertainment can also
						continue in another room, another box.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						What is the joy of family? When I was young, I heard people say many
						times that when I retired, I would be able to enjoy my family's
						happiness. I live with my grandchildren because my child is usually
						busy with work, so I come to help them with their children. I am
						delighted to see my grandchild growing up happily. School has just
						started recently, and the summer is over, so I'm sending my grandson
						to school again. In fact, I sometimes worry that the pandemic is so
						serious that I think we should not start the school year and how
						dangerous it is for the children to go back to school. I told my
						grandchild not to take off that mask when he is in school. The day
						begin for me as I watched my grandchild walk happily into school. I
						have to go for a PCR test, the pandemic over the past few years has
						almost become a habit, and I do not feel any inconvenience, except,
						sometimes, the line of people is a little long. But I'm retired, and
						there's nothing for me to really rush to finish. The recent pandemic
						is so serious that I heard that I have to get my PCR done for
						several days because there have been too many positive people in our
						city lately. I also heard that I am a close contact, so I am being
						managed in a focused way. I'm not afraid to go to quarantine, I saw
						some videos of people singing and dancing in the hospital before,
						and it didn't seem so bad, right? Obeying the government's decision
						is one of the few things we can do now. After all, we don't have the
						knowledge of experts to understand the disease. After a few days of
						continuous PCR tests, I am positive for the virus, and I am going to
						be quarantined. I hope my child can take care of their children
						well.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>
					<p>
						There is a park near my house that was built for the victims of the
						earthquake. I sometimes go to that park for a walk, maybe because
						that earthquake is related to my personal experience, or maybe I
						just want to have a place to breathe. When you reach middle age, you
						are probably under more pressure than when you are young. I've been
						walking around the park, and I'm likely to get immersed in the
						environment without realizing it. Sometimes I ramble, watch and
						think in this park, and a few hours pass. From the sunset until the
						city lights turned on, I slowly went home. Back home, the warmth of
						home is a good place to end the day. When I woke up, life seemed to
						have taken a few twists and turns, and we were all in close contact
						with a positive patient. We couldn't leave the house for the next
						few days until we were sure we weren't at risk of infection. What
						does quarantine mean to me? I can’t go to work, either my wife, my
						kids can't go to school, and my mom will be forced to stay at home.
						Our whole family's life will have to be put on hold. Am I scared,
						you ask? To be honest, maybe I'm a little scared, but what can I do?
						The big picture is important. Just like the earthquake, there is
						probably no shortage of heroes around us, so let's focus on the big
						picture. This time, I can probably guess the result of the PCR test,
						it is positive, I am going to be quarantined, my whole family will
						all have to go to quarantine. I can't do anything about it.
					</p>
					<hr></hr>

						Each individual in the city is like a grain of sand, we all exist
						alone anyway. You can say that no grain of sand is the same; you can
						also say that no snowflake is the same. Our lives are different but
						may be similar at some point. You carefully pick up two sand grains
						from the seaside and look at them carefully under a magnifying
						glass. You find that there seems to be some resemblance between them
						when viewed from certain angles. Maybe it's the material, or maybe
						it's the weathered edges. I wonder if you have ever suspected at
						some point that these two sands were from the same millions of years
						ago, but you just don't know how they split into two. Maybe all
						sands were originally one giant sand, for some reasons, who knows
						how many separate individuals it was divided into, or maybe there
						was no sand in this world in the first place. Our lives are
						different, but perhaps it is the arrangement of fate, the
						overlapping trajectories of the complex possibilities that arise.
						But it is the few overlaps that allow each other who travel
						separately to the same destination.
					</p>
					<p>
						To be honest, we never thought about getting to know each other, nor
						did we know in what way we would get to know each other. We tried to
						think about what made us all end up being the same, was it because
						we lived close together? I don't know who among us changed my
						destiny, and sometimes I wonder again if it makes sense to ask such
						questions. I don't understand, and I don't want to understand, and I
						can't understand. Do you think I should be angry?
					</p>
					<p>
						We live in different parts of the city, we have different
						occupations in society, and our families are made up of various
						members. What makes us so alike? What makes our lives intersect? It
						is not difficult to understand that although our lives seem to be
						different, we cannot escape from the basic human need—to eat. Each
						of us, and I mean each of us, has to work hard for food, maybe
						buying groceries at the supermarket, maybe eating at a restaurant.
						The unavoidable actions that we take create an inevitable
						intersection. Do you think I should self-blame?
					</p>
					<p>
						In fact, other parts of our lives make us become the target of the
						public. I'm curious what that means, being asymptomatic positive.
						What do you think? I think the first thing is that we can't realize
						we are carrying the virus. We feel good, we feel normal. Crafty
						virus! If we feel sick, we probably won't buy groceries for our
						family, and if we feel sick, we probably won't even leave the house.
						The tricky virus, using me as a carrier, using me to hurt others
						without hurting me. That's what you think, don’t you? Do you think I
						should feel guilty?
					</p>
					<p>
						By the way, my "friend" talked to me the other day. If that's how
						you want to refer to our relationship. I didn't know this person
						before but as I said, we became the same kind of people. Anyway, my
						"friend" told me that day that he would go out even if he felt sick.
						I asked him where he had gone that day. He told me that he had gone
						to a funeral. I didn't know what it meant to him, a funeral for a
						loved one or a funeral for something else? I didn't dare to ask
						more. After all, the type of funeral would not change the nature of
						his grief. A funeral! Let me think about that, if I was sick, would
						I attend this funeral? Would I pass this disease on to others, so
						that the sadness already present at the funeral would become a
						mixture of pity, anger, and grief? I didn't dare to think about it,
						but on the day my "friend" attended that funeral, I went to the mall
						to buy gifts for my family members who were expecting a birthday
						party. I had a wonderful day.
					</p>
					<p>
						Speaking of which, you may have forgotten, or maybe I didn't tell
						you, that we are forty-four individuals, forty-four individuals
						talking to you together, forty-four families. It's hard to believe
						when I know what everyone else has been up to these days. Our lives
						are moving in different directions, there are some points of
						intersection, but our lives are so different. I thought our lives
						were not comparable, I thought we were the denominations of our own
						lives, but yesterday, all of our lives took a pause. When I say
						pause, I mean forty-four of us, all at home, not going anywhere, not
						doing anything! It seems that since yesterday, everything we need to
						accomplish has disappeared. The trivial things in life have
						disappeared without a trace, leaving only one important thing. I
						don't know if I should complain. The education I received from a
						young age tells me that the big picture is the most important thing.
						Do you think sacrificing what I want to do and taking me to
						quarantine will save my city? When I think about it, my "friend"
						should be considered lucky that day of the funeral. How should we
						say goodbye if the funeral is delayed? Can he still go? Is the death
						of a life predictable?
					</p>
					<p>
						The bustling marketplace is a symbol of people's happiness and
						abundance. When everyone still has their own life and purpose, it
						seems that prosperity never stops. I sometimes feel that society is
						a huge machine that can't stop running, maybe going on forever,
						possibly breaking through all kinds of obstacles. I'm afraid no
						force can counteract the inertia of this machine when it stops! A
						force made up of us ordinary people. But I wonder, although our
						lives are different, is there really any difference? I mean, when
						that person went to the breakfast place on the east side of the town
						and I went to the breakfast place on the west side of the city, it
						seemed that our lives were only different in terms of location, but
						we were all just running around trying to survive, and I don't know
						how to explain that strange and familiar feeling. Can flesh and
						blood be built into a new great wall, an impenetrable wall of steel?
						Or is it that, as we follow the flood, the flood of life, is
						actually a river that has been diverted? The endless flow of the
						river seems unstoppable, but the water, is it just in the
						established journey to the destination that has been planned? I
						don't understand, I'm just an ordinary person. I sometimes feel that
						I am a feather, and we are all the same feather as me. One feather
						flies towards you without any weight. Forty-four feathers fly
						together toward you without any weight. A light net can change the
						flight path of a feather and even trap it, right?
					</p>
					<p>"Stop!"</p>
					<p>
						With a single command, the lives of forty-four of us stop
						immediately, without the slightest hesitation, without the slightest
						choice.
					</p>
					<p>"Quarantine!"</p>
					<p>
						Again, forty-four of us without the slightest hesitation, without
						the slightest choice. Perhaps we can all shout out the same phrase
						together: I'm going to be quarantined.
